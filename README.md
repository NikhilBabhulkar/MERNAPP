# MERN APPLICATION

This project was Made up with technologies like React Node(Express js) MongoDB Atlas 

## Main Aim - USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORISATION

### Features Provided
A User can register himself on the platform and then he has to login himself to access the hidden features in the application 
so I have created a middleware with checks the user session in the backend code and we have simply stored the session of a user in the MongoDB atlas
at the time of login, the user gets the session id or token which again get validates the time of visitation to the secret page 
I have used jwt of that reason with is JSON web token

#### React Hooks
I have used react hooks for the data storing here I have collected the data from the input field using react useState and 
the time we have to send the whole dataset at the backend I have sent using react hook
